## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/

## Solution
1. Can use a set but that will be extra space
2. Can set both 2nd and 3rd to Integer.MIN_VALUE, but that won't pass test case [1,2]
3. Use Integer as it can be initialized as null

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        Integer first = null, second = null, third = null;
        
        for(Integer n: nums){
            if(first == null || n > first){
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = n;
            }else if((second == null || n > second) && !n.equals(first)){
                third = second;
                second = n;
            }else if((third == null || n > third) && !n.equals(first) && !n.equals(second)){
                third = n;
            }
        }
        return third == null ? first : third;   
    }
}


```

## Complexity
Time: O(N)

Space: O(1)

## Thoughts
1. Right: `if(first == null || n > first)`

   Wrong: `if(n > first || first == null)`

   Because || is from left to right, if compare with n while first is null, will throw error "java.lang.NullPointerException"

2. Right: `!n.equals(first)`

   Wrong: `n != first`
   
   Because it's comparing Integer objs
