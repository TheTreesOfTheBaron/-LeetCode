## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-to-array-form-of-integer/

## Solution
1. Can't compute directly as the number could be too large
2. So take k as a carry,then add it to the last digit of the array, update k, and the last digit of k would be the new digit of the array, update array
3. k /= 10, continue with the second lowest digit of the array
4. Repeat

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> addToArrayForm(int[] num, int k) {
        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        int len = num.length-1;
        while(len>=0 || k!= 0){
            if(len>=0)
            {
                k+=num[len];
                len--;
            }
            list.add(0,k%10); // if LinkedList<Integer> list, could use addFirst()
            k = k / 10;
        }
        return list;
    }
}

```

## Complexity
Time: **O(max(N, log10(K)))**, where N is the length of the array and log10(K) is the number of digits in k.

Space: **O(max(N, log10(K)))**, not an in-place as we need space equal to the given k or length of array, whichever is maximum between the two, to store the elements.

## Thoughts
1. Pay attention to large numbers
2. Can return a LinkedList obj even if the return type is List, but better to return List
3. 从低位到高位计算，处理进位
