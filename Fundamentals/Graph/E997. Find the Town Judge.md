## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/

## Solution
1. Graph. (inDeg/be trusted) - (outDeg/trust) == n - 1.
2. Store each person's 信任值 as their degree in an array，trust -1，be trusted +1. The judge trusts 0 time and be trusted n-1 times，so their 信任值 is n-1. Other people's should be less than n-1 as they trust others. 
2. Check the array and if there is a value of n-1, return index + 1.


**Other methods**
1. Can use 2 arrays, one for inDeg, and another for outDeg. Judge should be n-1 and 0. But one array works as well in this problem. 


## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] count = new int[n];
        for(int[] pair: trust){
            count[pair[0] - 1]--;
            count[pair[1] - 1]++;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < count.length; i++){
            if(count[i] == n-1) return i + 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity
T: O(max(n, trust.length))

S: O(n)
